              <p>Wardell Stephen Curry II (Akron, Ohio, March 14, 1988) is an American basketball player who belongs to the NBA Golden State Warriors team. At 1.88 meters tall, he plays in the point guard position.</p>
              <p>He played for three seasons for the Davidson College Wildcats, averaging 25.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game. It didn't take him long to demonstrate his qualities, since in his second official game, against the Michigan Wolverines, he got 32 points, 9 rebounds and 4 assists.</p>
              <p>Curry was selected seventh overall in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. His contract as a rookie was $12.7 million over four years. In the first game of his career, he scored 14 points and distributed 7 assists.</p>

              <p>In May 2011, Curry had surgery on his right ankle to repair torn ligaments caused by multiple sprains from last season.</p>
              <p>Before the start of the 2012–13 season, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Warriors. At the time, many basketball journalists considered the renewal risky for Golden State due to the player's injury history..</p>
              <p>At the start of the 2014-15 season, the Warriors hired former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr as their new coach. Kerr implemented significant changes to Golden State's schemes, including playing at a faster pace and giving Curry more freedom to shoot.</p>
              <p>The Warriors defeated the Rockets and reached the final against the Cleveland Cavaliers, where Curry started off quietly, making just 22 percent of his shots from the field in Game 2.</p>
              <p>In Game 5, he scored 37 points, and in Game 6, Golden State closed out the series to win its first championship in 40 years. In the Finals, Curry averaged 26 points and 6.3 assists per game.</p>

                <p>In a 122-114 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans, Curry hit four 3-pointers to reach 1,600 in his career, becoming the 19th player to do so, as well as the youngest to do so. On November 4, 2016, Curry's streak was snapped, leaving a record 157 consecutive games scoring at least one 3-pointer, during the Warriors' 117-97 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. A streak that had begun on November 11, 2014. Three days later, he made 13 3-pointers against New Orleans, setting the NBA record for 3-pointers in a regular-season game (surpassed in 2018 by teammate Klay Thompson with 14). . Curry was 16-for-26 shooting against the Pelicans for his first 40-point game of the season, finishing with 46 in a 116-106 win.</p>
                <p>On December 11, Curry made two 3-pointers against the Minnesota Timberwolves to pass Steve Nash for 17th on the NBA career 3-point list. With 14 points against the Dallas Mavericks on December 30, Curry (11,903) passed Purvis Short (11,894) for seventh on the Warriors' franchise list. In a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on January 6, 2017, Curry made his second 40-point game of the season and reached the 12,000-point threshold, becoming only the seventh player in Warriors history to score 12,000 points. Three days later, Curry was named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, January 2 through Sunday, January 8. He earned his eighth career Player of the Week, more than any other player in franchise history. He was chosen to play the All-Star as a starter in the West.</p>
